# Javascript-Project

This project mainly focuses on what I believed would be the main functions needed for a recipe page. I included: a search bar, an email form (with validation), 
a modal that appears when the recipe card is clicked on, this displays more information about the dish with a link to the recipe that is provided by the API used(Recipe puppy).
Furthermore, I included some js to my animation so that when clicked, the animation will restart, allowing there to be interactivity. This is only on the home page, as after this page, seeing the same animation becomes jarring.

Additionally, the original wireframes included a favourites bar. However, with the data given by the API, I felt it was not relevant to the webpages as there were only 10 inputs. 
I felt as though that would be more appropriate for webpages with considerable amount of data. In the end, I am content with the way this js project turned out.


The wireframes are all linked in the 'Links to projects' document.
